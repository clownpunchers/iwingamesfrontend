        Welcome to iWin Gaming...your home for free-play games that offer you
        the opportunity to play for significant prizes. The iWin Gaming Team is
        comprised of highly skilled experts in the fields of gaming, non-profit
        fundraising, technology, marketing and advertising. Our unique business
        model helps companies target consumers through our player specific
        feedback. We have developed a multi & mutually beneficial community that
        creates a highly interactive and unique experience between consumer,
        advertiser, celebrity, and nonprofit organization. Our model is based on
        transparency, honesty, integrity and is designed to empower the
        player/consumer. By delivering high value demographic information back
        to our advertising partners, we are able to provide fun and interactive
        contests, with the chance for people to win life changing financial
        prizes (up to $millions), while raising significant and much needed
        funds for different non-profit organizations (NPO's) around the world.
        We are thrilled to be able to bring you, your friends, and fellow game
        lovers, the chance to win the most and biggest prizes per tournament,
        while playing in a fun and cost to you. There are no entry fees and no
        costs to you throughout any of our tournaments. All of our games are
        completely legal in most US states as well as the rest of the world
        where online “gaming” is restricted. We have created a very cool
        tournament structure that lets you enter as many times as you like with
        the only restriction being that you must be 18 to play. As IWin Gaming
        does not charge our players to play, we fall under sweepstakes
        regulations, which allows us to operate in markets where most other
        firms cannot. We are confident that you will love our game as iWin was
        started by a group of gaming enthusiasts and professionals who were
        determined to make things better for social gaming lovers. We tore apart
        everything that everyone else was doing, kept what people love and
        didn’t stop tinkering until it was more fun, simpler to play, and most
        importantly, easier to win real prizes. We are able to offer life
        changing prizes as we found a way to work with advertisers and top
        brands to create a win-win-win proposition for everyone. Our advertising
        partners are happy to provide you the opportunity to win amazing prizes,
        and all they ask is that you simply pay attention to their commercials
        and/or banner ads before or during a respective tournament, and watch
        for special offers during the tournament. We believe that we have
        designed the ideal way to get this done, so everyone should be happy. If
        not, we promise to adjust things, so please let us know because we are
        building this together. It is very important for our community to
        understand that it is our advertising partners who are providing the
        wonderful prizes. We have designed our platform so that you are not
        being bombarded with intrusive advertisements. Rather, passive banner
        ads and video commercials will rotate throughout the frame, but they do
        not interfere with your play. Your participation is key to our long term
        success, but just as importantly, the more data you are willing to
        provide, the better the prizes we can offer you. As an example, we will
        be giving away automobiles, boats, vacation trips of a lifetime, and
        much more. When you tell us what you want, we will strive to deliver
        exactly that when your name gets drawn. Chat-Smack with your favorite
        stars! To make things even better, we have partnered with famous
        athletes, musicians, actors, and comedians, some of whom may be your
        heroes. You can see them, interact with them, and maybe even end up
        seated next to them in a live game in their own branded rooms where you
        can win prizes supplied by them, enter contests, and "smack chat with
        them, all while kicking their butts in our different game options.
